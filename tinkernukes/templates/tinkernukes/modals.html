            <h3>What the heck is this?</h3>
            <p>
                Tinkernukes is a player-made tool for the science-fiction MMORPG <a href="https://anarchy-online.com">Anarchy Online</a>. In 2022, many existing Nanotechnician nuke tables are either majorly out-of-date, no longer supported, or have disappeared entirely. I've set out to create an updated, accurate tool that allows NT players to quickly and easily identify nukes that will perform well for their current build and abilities. 
            </p>
            <h3>How accurate is it?</h3>
            <p>
                As accurate as I can make it all by my little lonesome. I won't claim that it's perfect in every case, though, so if you find an inaccuracy, please get in touch and I'll get it fixed. Further, while it may be accurate, it may not always be optimal, as some of the mechanics involved with NT nukes are not perfectly understood. The calculations used by Tinkernukes are based on the best information the AO player community has to offer. 
            </p>
            <h3>I need to contact you!</h3>
            <p>
                Great! I can be found on the official Anarchy Online discord as TinkeringIdiot#7251 (@TinkeringIdiot), or you can email me at admin(AT)tinkeringidiot.com. 
            </p>
            <h3>What's your privacy policy?</h3>
            <p>
                Tinkernukes doesn't gather or store any information about you. There's no login or account, and there never will be. There is a session that stores only the profile you specify in the tool, and that is wiped after 6 hours of inactivity. Google Analytics is used to monitor visitor statistics, their privacy policy is <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">here</a>.

                Big thanks to <a href="https://auno.org">Auno</a> for creating the Anarchy Online database dumper I used to make Tinkernukes, and to <a href="https://github.com/bitnykk">Bitnykk</a> for updating it to support later versions of the game. Also thanks to <a href="https://www.ao-universe.com">the AO-Universe team</a> for the excellent guides on breed and initiative mechanics. Big thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090607194521/http://www.ramorak.com/sl/nukes.asp?name=200+Solitus+NT&lvl=200&mc=1120&ni=1250&deck=4&ac=15000&end=1.07&aggdef=100&sec=30&pool=9200&he=940&ns=26.875&crunch=28&xcost=22&eon=1100&cn=0&nsrc=0&range=36&xrange=20&pg=1&s1=&s2=d&det=b">Ramorak</a> for the excellent, if no longer available, nuke table that helped inspire my effort here. Tinkernukes wouldn't have been possible without all these fine folks, and I truly appreciate their efforts.
