            TinkerTools are a set of utilities and helpers for the Sci-Fi MMORPG <a href="https://www.anarchy-online.com">Anarchy Online</a>. They are provided free of charge to the player community in the hope that they can enhance the joy of playing one of the most complex and fun video games on Earth.

        <span class="text-justify">In 2022, many existing implant design tools are either majorly out-of-date, no longer supported, or require download and installation. I've set out to create an updated, accurate tool that allows players to plan out their implants in a web-browser, with a few extra features that I've always wished other tools supported (JOBE clusters, refined implants, QL bumping, etc). </span>

        <span class="text-justify">One of the outstanding difficulties in Anarchy Online is deciding which weapon to use. With over 10,000 weapons available, the "right" choice isn't always clear...assuming you even know what all the options are. Tinkerfite sets out to help alleviate that problem by suggesting weapons you can use based on your stats and skills, so you're always making an informed choice. </span>

While we all hope this is a temporary situation, Tinkerpocket serves as a less-awesome backup to make that information available to players until it returns. </span>
