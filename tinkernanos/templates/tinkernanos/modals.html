            <h3>What the heck is this?</h3>
            <p>
                Tinkernanos is a player-made tool for the science-fiction MMORPG <a href="https://anarchy-online.com">Anarchy Online</a>. In 2023, the popular AO database 
                site AOItems went offline for an extended period, and took the best resource for listing nano programs with it. I've set out to create an updated, accurate
                tool that allows players to easily find the nanos they need. 
            </p>
            <h3>How accurate is it?</h3>
            <p>
                As accurate as I can make it all by my little lonesome. I won't claim that it's perfect in every case, though, so if you find an inaccuracy, please get in touch 
                and I'll get it fixed. 
            </p>
            <h3>I need to contact you!</h3>
            <p>
                Great! I can be found on the official Anarchy Online discord as TinkeringIdiot#7251 (@TinkeringIdiot), or you can email me at admin(AT)tinkeringidiot.com. 
            </p>
            <h3>What's your privacy policy?</h3>
            <p>
                Tinkernukes doesn't gather or store any information about you. There's no login or account, and there never will be. There is a session that stores only 
                the profile you specify in the tool, and that is wiped after 6 hours of inactivity. Google Analytics is used to monitor visitor statistics, their privacy 
                policy is <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">here</a>. 
            </p>
            <h3>Thanks!</h3>
            <p>
                Big thanks to <a href="https://auno.org">Auno</a> for creating the Anarchy Online database dumper I used to make Tinkernukes, and to 
                <a href="https://github.com/bitnykk">Bitnykk</a> for updating it to support later versions of the game. Also thanks to 
                <a href="https://www.ao-universe.com">the AO-Universe team</a> for the excellent guides on breed and initiative mechanics. 
                And a huge thanks to Dyrshin for the kind allowance of their CDN space for icons. Tinkernukes wouldn't have been possible without all these fine folks, and I truly appreciate their efforts. 
            </p>
            <h3>How can I help?</h3>
            <p>
                Finding and reporting bugs is best, but if you'd like to help with hosting costs I certainly won't complain. I happily accept donations via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tinkeringidiot">Patreon</a> and cryptocurrency.
