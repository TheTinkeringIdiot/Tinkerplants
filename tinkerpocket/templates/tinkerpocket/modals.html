            <h3>What the heck is this?</h3>
            <p>
                Tinkerpocket is a player-made tool for the science-fiction MMORPG <a href="https://anarchy-online.com">Anarchy Online</a>. In February of 2023, one of AO's greatest resources, <a href="http://aopocket.tngk.com">http://aopocket.tngk.com</a> went offline. While we all hope this is a temporary situation, Tinkerpocket serves as a less-awesome backup to make that information available to players until it returns. 
            </p>
            <h3>How accurate is it?</h3>
            <p>
                As accurate as I can make it using the best information the AO player community has to offer. I won't claim that it's perfect in every case, though, so if you find an inaccuracy, please get in touch and I'll get it fixed.
            </p>
            <h3>I need to contact you!</h3>
            <p>
                Great! I can be found on the official Anarchy Online discord as TinkeringIdiot#7251 (@TinkeringIdiot), or you can email me at admin(AT)tinkeringidiot.com. 
            </p>
            <h3>What's your privacy policy?</h3>
            <p>
                Tinkerpocket doesn't gather or store any information about you. There's no login or account, and there never will be. There is a session that stores only the profile you specify in the tool, and that is wiped after 6 hours of inactivity. Google Analytics is used to monitor visitor statistics, their privacy policy is <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">here</a>.

            <h3>Thanks!</h3>
            <p>
                Big thanks to <a href="https://auno.org">Auno</a> for creating the Anarchy Online database dumper I used to make Tinkerfite, and to <a href="https://github.com/bitnykk">Bitnykk</a> for updating it to support later versions of the game. Also thanks to <a href="https://www.ao-universe.com">the AO-Universe team</a> and all the wonderful AOWiki authors for the excellent guides. And, of course, big thanks to bigwheels16 and the whole <a href="https://github.com/Budabot/Tyrbot">Tyrbot</a> team for the excellent lists of symbiants and pocket bosses. Tinkerpocket wouldn't have been possible without all these fine folks, and I truly appreciate their efforts. 
            </p>
            <h3>How can I help?</h3>
            <p>
                Finding and reporting bugs is best, but if you'd like to help with hosting costs I certainly won't complain. I happily accept donations via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tinkeringidiot">Patreon</a> and cryptocurrency.
